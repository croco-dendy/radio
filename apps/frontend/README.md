This is the frontend app for the **Polissya** Minecraft portal â€” a surreal pastel UI built with React and Tailwind.

- **TypeScript** â€” strict typing throughout
- **TailwindCSS** â€” custom config with pastel Ukrainian-themed palette
- **TanStack React Query** â€” for data fetching
- **Axios** â€” custom API layer
- **Zustand** â€” for lightweight state management
- **Vercel** â€” CI/CD + deployments

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Style

- Clean and minimal
- All functions use `const fn = () => {}` style
- Export at the bottom of the file as a list
- Logic is extracted to hooks or service modules
- Design system colors: `moss`, `bark`, `coal`, `clay`, `river`, `paper`, `sun`, `ember`

## ðŸš€ Development

```bash
pnpm dev # starts Vite dev server
```

## ðŸ§ª Environment Variables

Ensure you have the following in your `.env` file:

```

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

Preview and Production values are managed via Vercel environment settings.
